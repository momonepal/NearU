<br>

NearU is a hyperlocal social networking Native iOS App built in Swift/XCode with a custom Parse backend that allows users to share hyperlocal content in real time, view the local feed, and comment on posts within their local area.

The idea is to build this into something like yikyak or Jodel, where the social media interaction and influence is bounded to proximity. 
There is no pressure to build a persona as there are no profiles, or personas. 

And here's the early [*Pitchdeck for NearU* ](https://www.canva.com/design/DAFQV3D42yQ/vUb4-sGxcMvWC38p0MGAyA/view?utm_content=DAFQV3D42yQ&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=viewer#1) 
There have been some deviations in the projects. This repo serves as a POC/MVP.
